**Holographic To-Do List Application**

Holograms_v1 is an experimental task management app that renders 3D holographic representations of to-do list items in an interactive XYZ plane. Designed for immersive productivity environments, this project merges task organization with spatial visualization using WebGL/Three.js.

## Features

- âœ… Add tasks to your to-do list
- ðŸ“Š Each task is rendered as a floating 3D object in holographic space
- ðŸ§­ Real-time positioning along the X, Y, and Z axes
- ðŸŽ® Interactive controls for rotating and zooming in the hologram plane
- ðŸ§  Designed for intuitive visualization in VR/AR environments (compatible with WebXR)

## Demo

> Coming soon: Live WebGL/Three.js demo hosted on GitHub Pages

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js + Three.js (or Babylon.js)
- **3D Engine:** WebGL / WebXR
- **State Management:** Redux or Zustand
- **3D Asset Format:** JSON-based objects or GLTF
- **Build Tooling:** Vite or Webpack

## Setup

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/holograms_v1.git
cd holograms_v1

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the development server
npm run dev
```

## Usage
1. Launch the app
2. Enter a task in the input field
3. Press **Add Task**
4. The task appears in a 3D space rendered in real-time
5. Use your mouse or VR controls to explore the holographic space

## Roadmap
- [ ] Voice-based task entry
- [ ] Gesture support for AR interfaces
- [ ] Data persistence with localStorage / backend
- [ ] Priority-based color-coding
- [ ] Export holographic layout to 3D model
